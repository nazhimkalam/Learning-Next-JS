# Next JS

## What is next JS ?

**Next JS** is an open source React front-end development **web framework** that enables functionality such as **server-side rendering** and generating static websites for React based web applications.


**Server-side rendering (SSR)** is the process of rendering web pages on a **server** and **passing** them to the browser **(client-side)**, *instead of rendering them in the browser.*


**NextJs** provides server side rendering **(SSR)** while Create React App provides client side rendering **(CSR)** and SSR improves **performance of Application Loading**.
